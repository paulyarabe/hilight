book_notes = ["This book grew out of my Greek publisher’s invitation, back in 2013, to talk directly to young people about the economy. My reason for writing it was the conviction that the economy is too important to leave to the economists.\\n\\nJune 23, 2018", "There was another reason I agreed to write this book. My daughter Xenia is an almost constant absence in my life. Living as she does in Australia and I in Greece, we are either far apart or, when we are together, counting the days until the next separation. Talking as if to her about things that the scarcity of time never allowed us to discuss felt good.\\n\\nJune 23, 2018", "Writing the book was a joy. It is the only text I have written without any footnotes, references or the paraphernalia of academic or political books. Unlike those ‘serious’ books, I wrote it in my native tongue. In fact, I just sat down at our island home in Aegina, overlooking the Saronic Gulf and the mountains of the Peloponnese in the distance, and let the book write itself – without a plan or provisional table of contents or blueprint to guide me. It took nine days\\n\\nJune 23, 2018", "Aborigines had poetry, music and myths of tremendous cultural value, but they didn’t have the means to attack other peoples or to defend themselves from the armies, the weapons and the germs that agricultural surplus-producing economies engender. In contrast the British, coming from Eurasia, had been forced by climate and need to generate large surpluses and all that came with them, from seagoing vessels to biochemical weapons. As a result, when they arrived on the Australian coast, the Aborigines didn’t stand a chance.\\n\\nJune 24, 2018", "Geographical conditions predetermined that Africa, Australia and the Americas would be colonized by Europeans. It had nothing to do with DNA, character or intelligence. To put it simply but accurately, it was all due to the shape and location of the different continents. But there’s also another type of inequality that geography cannot explain: inequality within the same community or country.\\n\\nJune 24, 2018", "Remember how agricultural surplus gave rise to the state and clergy? Its accumulation both required and led to an over-concentration of power, and consequently wealth, among the few who ruled over the rest – known as the oligarchy, which comes from the Greek words oligoi (‘the few’) and arkhein (‘to rule’).\\n\\nJune 24, 2018", "nothing is reproduced with greater ease than the faith of the haves that they deserve what they get. Since childhood you have been caught up in a vicious logical contradiction that you barely noticed. On the one hand, you were appalled by the idea that some kids cry themselves to sleep because they are hungry. On the other, you were thoroughly convinced (like all children) that your toys, your clothes and your house were all rightfully yours. Our minds automatically equate ‘I have X’ with ‘I deserve X’.\\n\\nJune 24, 2018", "At any rate, debt came first. And since the amount of money paid to waged workers as wages, the amount of rent paid to the lord, the sums to be paid for raw materials and tools were all determined and agreed even before production had begun, the distribution of the entrepreneur’s future revenues was largely decided in advance of their existence – in fact, the only person who did not know how much he would end up with, after everyone else got paid, was the entrepreneur himself. In brief, distribution now preceded production. This is how the Great Reversal took place, turning debt into the primary factor and the essential lubricant of the production process. This is also how profit became an end in itself – for without it the new entrepreneurial class could not survive. Think about it. If the price of wool suddenly plummeted or some natural disaster reduced output, they would not only starve but end up with unpayable debts. As the expiry of their loan agreement approached, they would sink deeper and deeper into despair.\\n\\nJuly 22, 201"]
