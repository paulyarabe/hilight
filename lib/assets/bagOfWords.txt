smells unlock my every memory like i m moving through a sensory doorway to the past where all my senses translate into a scent or an aroma conjuring a vivid recall transported to a specific time and place i m suddenly seeing hearing tasting and touching everything around me this link between the sense of smell and human emotion would be one of the truths of fragrance i would come to understand patrick s skind in his novel perfume odors have a power of persuasion stronger than that of words appearances emotions or will it enters into us like breath into our lungs it fills us up imbues us totally there is no remedy for it eau sauvage a cologne by christian dior unmistakably dad with his starched collar and crisp white shirts ironed to within an inch of their life he s sitting in his armchair right ankle resting on left knee creating a cradle between his legs he called this his dip the spot where i would sit listening to his stories facing his moustached smile seeing the reflection of myself in his black thick rimmed glasses this was my favourite place in the world even as a little girl i knew from mum s choice of fragrance what her mood or the occasion was je reviens by worth headed to work serious professional joy going to london feeling confident out to impress at somewhere fancy ma griffe by carven summer time a spring in her step holidays in cornwall and mary chess tapestry bath oil friday night unwinding time to herself the scent that infused the rest of the house whenever she took a bath whatever she wore its composition nearly always contained notes of jasmine and rose and i could often smell her before seeing her either as a reassurance that she was close i didn t smell much money in my childhood instead i can recall the array of scents from the amazing flowers in our back garden the apricot white and red roses the blue lobelia the greengage tree the lemon scented geraniums and the fresh mint the ingredients for my first home made perfume mixed in a jam jar and left to ferment in dad s garden shed this was no flashforward of my future most girls experiment in this way i think but it was perhaps me trying to capture the pleasant smells of days spent in the garden even as a child family meant everything to me but that sense of cohesive togetherness was inconsistent and fleeting and dad s festive drink a snowball no matter how tight things were financially my parents constantly delivered a magical happy christmas it s why it remains my favourite time of year don t ask me how they afforded it but without fail we woke to a generous amount of presents we never went short in that regard if there was one thing i learned from watching him stare into space puffing away it is the truth that you can t force creativity he could sit there for hours without picking up his brushes but as he explained creativity needs to be respected it is not a tap that can simply be turned on it comes when ready not when forced or unfelt waiting he said was part of the creative process let inspiration come to you don t chase it within a few weeks and when i felt confident enough i started to emerge from his shadow more and more telling curious customers about the story behind each painting for example take the clipper painting i d describe its history and the voyage it was embarking on transporting them from the market and into the painting in the same way dad had done with me the hook of a good story often led to a sale a mental note to be registered for later life n njanuary 15 2018 we weren t allowed to interrupt her concentration but i d watch her through the kitchen window and observe her intense focus i could see how much this new job meant to her by the way she threw herself into these studies within no time she had qualified with distinction as an aestheticienne a beauty therapist in the subjects of anatomy physiology and massage i felt so proud of her she had found that one thing in life that made her happy but it was the lab where all the magic happened that left me endlessly fascinated it was as heavenly white as a john lennon imagine video white paint white shelves white cupboards white cups white plates white racks underfoot the black and white tiles ran throughout on the walls were bevelled mirrors on the ceilings twinkling chandeliers the whiteness of everything made the place feel so serene and safe she showed me the beauty of creativity the fantasy world of product the magic of mixing lotions and what it was to be an artist she turned on a light in the deepest parts of me and that light would only glow brighter with time she also divulged a little known tip that made me understand the reasoning behind whiteness in a room one interior colour plus very little sound allows the eyes and ears to relax so that the scents in the air are the only stimulant for the senses i soon saw for myself why her incredibly high standards had played a huge part in her success if a pastry or cup of tea wasn t perfect she d send it back in the same way she would reject a face cream if it wasn t absolutely perfect if you can t do something perfectly she told me once then don t do it all you must do everything brilliantly i can t say that my school years were a bed of roses either i have few fond memories of my time at comprehensive school for me this period was a rite of passage the quagmire between childhood and adulthood that i had to wade through i struggled academically seemingly unable to retain any information nothing would go in some afternoons i d come home and want to cry with frustration because i felt stupid in fact i worried endlessly that i was stupid the teachers were of little help and i didn t feel able to speak with mum and dad because they seemed to have enough on their plates moreover i didn t want to let them down with my poor performance not that they took much interest anyway madame lubatti s head moved falteringly and she looked right at me or rather through me the eyes that once sparkled now looked as empty as a dried up well to see someone who has given so much to your life in such a state was the most shocking thing i know mum found it distressing too her tears told me that the room was sparsely decorated with a generic painting on the wall there wasn t an oil bottle face cream or herb in sight nothing that plugged her into her heart and soul even as a youngster i could see how such an ordinary environment hardly helped her cause the trouble with my parents was that they were two tormented souls who adored one another even though it sometimes didn t sound or feel like it they were the can t live with can t live without type of couple i know a deep love existed beneath all their ego and resentment i know it because i witnessed it one christmas morning after tracey and i had finished opening our presents in front of the fire one little unwrapped red box remained under the tree one more i squealed what s this what s this that s for your mum said dad taking it from me to present to mum who was all aflutter when she realised she had a surprise mum convinced him that as he was a good cook who easily followed recipes he would also make an able assistant she left him with a copy of harry s cosmeticology the must read book in cosmetic chemistry and showed him what to do step by step over and over again until satisfied that he knew what he was doing dad was a smart man and a fast learner and equally as important this new role gave him a sense of renewed purpose soon enough he was running that kitchen lab like he d been doing it for years allowing mum to focus on her clients when i arrived home from school and smelled oils and waxes it was actually a comforting aroma since it meant something was being made something productive was happening and dad was occupied which meant mum would be happy with all pistons firing and all hands on deck a busy house pulling in the same direction often meant a harmonious house and that was fine by me dad s soul needed the stimulus of creativity and the respect of being valued by others don t look back keep moving forward when there s a business to run run it that tends to be the best approach it wasn t mills boon it wasn t paris it wasn t planned and there was no ring but that was the most romantic thing he could have done in my eyes marriage is about for better or worse and at my worst with no make up reddened eyes and feeling desperately low he was essentially telling me that he wanted me to be his forever and that he d be there by my side for me romance is about the intensity and meaning of a moment and his strength and love had never meant more i adored every aspect about this man his heart kindness and compassion and still do from that day forward his love would be the most constant thing i would ever know unwavering and unconditional without it without him i wouldn t go on to achieve anything gary would drop me off in london around 9 a m and i would jump in a taxi throughout the day and bounce from house to house from belgravia to knightsbridge chelsea to kensington until he picked me up around 6 p m i would continue in this vein for the next six months building a platform becoming established and counting on this expanding network to keep putting my name out there think of how much we ll save in taxi fares and petrol he said think of the extra facials you could fit in working from one home based clinic instead of dashing all over london he calculated that by increasing the price of a treatment by 5 to 50 we d pretty much break even initially a move to london made sense on every level besides the business not us seemed to be dictating matters we decided to follow her lead and see where she took us we did what every entrepreneur must do when they are in the fortunate position of being able to harness momentum we decided to leap again trusting in what we had the flat was not luxurious by any means even if the address may have been and it was there that i discovered how much the sense of smell could bring luxury into even the most sparsely decorated room i wanted the sense of luxury to permeate the whole flat for my benefit and that of the clients i d burn different types of scented candles infusing the flat with clean relaxing aromas that brought me a sense of security i did all this instinctively at the time the idea that i would one day create my own fragrances hadn t yet crossed my mind i wanted to create the kind of space where clients could unload their troubles and stresses and step into a calming bubble for body and spirit i wanted to go beyond anything i had previously seen with madame lubatti and mum it had to feel sensational like nothing anyone had known over the years many people from all walks of life would trot up and down our three flights of stairs from celebrities actors pop stars tv hosts supermodels and members of royalty from around the world to clients who would save up to afford a facial every three months skin doesn t recognise class and there is something about the intimate space between the face girl and client that is a great leveller the treatment room is a good place to realise that we re all human with the same skin issues same emotions same flaws and that fame and wealth aren t character traits i took the privacy of each client seriously human nature is divided between those who thrive on and get easily distracted by gossip and they tend to go nowhere and those people who know their purpose know what they want and won t give weight to the chirpings of misinformed tittle tattle because they know that such things are a waste of focus and energy one week i made a papaya mask with sandalwood powder set in a cool jelly but three women s faces broke out in a rash and i had to hurriedly apply plain yoghurt as a soothing balm ironically it was those flare ups that led me to a breakthrough the creation of a nourishing gel that calmed everything from rashes to sunburn to blemishes before i knew it clients were raving about this wonder product saying how much softer and fresher their skin felt after using it as we talked he said he could supply the juice le jus the concentrate of a fragrance that gives any cream lotion gel oil or perfume its name i ll tell you what i ll do he said i ll put one kilo through as a sample and see how you get on once the lotion had proved a hit i set about making an accompanying bath oil because i had long believed that the sensual experience of taking a bath required more than ambient warmth steam and a few candles dotted around the edges it demanded the luxury of fragrance nutmeg ginger bath oil actually became a gift to those clients who had been with me from the start presented in my plain white gift bags my small way of saying thank you in my mind this gift formed only a sample of limited stock and that s when things started going crazy clients didn t only order one bottle of bath oil but five and then ten i had a roll of sticky labels that we fed through a second hand typewriter we d bought for 25 using two index fingers i d stab out the name of the product to be affixed to the back of the bottle on the front i d use pre printed stickers from prontaprint bearing my initials jlm we d then crawl back into bed and sit there leaning back against our pillows with notepads on raised knees and discuss where we went wrong and what we could improve and then at the end of each month we d sit in the living room and spread our bank statements on the floor cross referencing them with my ryman s duplicate page invoice book to calculate what money we had left over we would come to realise that success begets success and i think many entrepreneurs will associate with this once you begin to feel successful and embrace the natural momentum of the business you tend to manifest a confidence that magnetises more success until it snowballs my only motivation was the love for our little business and the development of our product line as if led by some mission statement written by my creative soul forget what everyone else is doing go in your own direction get it right but most of all be original there was a whole new language to grasp such as the accord that happens when individual ingredients blend to become a unified scent or the notes that make up a fragrance s composition a top note the first impression the accent that soon fades the middle the core and most distinguishable scent and the base the longest lasting essence the truth left on the skin while we may work with chemicals compounds and molecules it is not a science but an art the art of fragrance complete with its own sculpted structure and musicality if music is an art emitted by sound waves then perfumery is an art emitted by olfactory vibrations a fragrance unfolds in three acts as the alcohol evaporates during the dry down period act one comes in the first minute teasing the scent to come act two kicks in after about five minutes when the molecules react with the skin and the fragrance starts to reveal its story and act three ten minutes in provides the crescendo when after full absorption the evocative essence truly settles on the skin personally the most rewarding moment is when a fragrance proves its worth and starts communicating using the different notes of its composition to express itself and then when everyone starts buying it raving about its qualities and how its essence makes them feel i can sit back and feel like a proud parent once i felt i had pinned down the general idea i called derek and briefed him verbally that i wanted to create a lime basil mandarin fragrance outlining which notes i wanted to emerge first which should hover in the background and which should linger and that s what sent me into true fragrance development with a perfumer in paris in 1991 for me the preciseness of that translation is everything i have to sniff the blend and know that he has delivered an interpretation faithful to the scent i have in mind not close or there or thereabouts but spot on these interpretations hinge on the tiniest finely measured fractions as the perfumer creates different variants of the same fragrance a teeny bit more juice in variant a a smidgen less in variant b a different molecule in c and so on and so forth through variants d e and f my lifelong association with beauty and cosmetics had been steeped in natural ingredients ever since i walked into madame lubatti s lab and so for me the ingredients had to be the hero i didn t want to promise anything other than a beautifully constructed fragrance and i wanted my notes to be front and centre reflecting a truth of human interaction we smell a fragrance our attention is drawn and then we see the wearer scent leads image follows buying a perfume or cologne can t suddenly make you sexier or more powerful or more successful you can only enjoy its notes and feel good and call it by its name back at the flat i started offering four scents during a treatment and each client couldn t wait to find out the fragrances of the day which in turn led to more local buzz and more sales our flat started to resemble and smell like a lab look he said i m prepared to give up my job and dedicate my time to you and the business but you need a shop we ve outgrown here fear the enemy of any entrepreneur we had food on the table and bills that could be paid including our rent and mortgage payments you realise we could lose it all i said quickly becoming flustered owning a business isn t rocket science it s about courage creativity and faith and i don t mind admitting that i temporarily mislaid two of those prerequisites for a moment admittedly not everyone was keen on progress i had built a somewhat exclusive club of ladies i had around 750 clients at this point and one or two frowned at the prospect of me opening a shop i think human nature likes being in on secrets and some women liked wearing a fragrance that wasn t commonly available we had three months to get everything in place transform the unit find suppliers design a brand interview candidates to be our two shop assistants and find a factory to make the creams lotions and bath oils in bulk the days of four plastic jugs and home made products were over we now had to adhere to stringent compliance regulations that came with opening a shop we re building a brand he said and we have to build it from the top we can t be shy we can t build from the bottom and hope to climb you start high in the marketplace establish yourself then move down everything we do now from this point the first impression we leave the manners of our staff the packaging we use the style of the shop the interviews we give has to reflect the elegance of not only our product but our target audience over the next week i undertook the laborious task of committing my recipes to paper for the first time it took me hours but it was worth every minute when the first samples came back this man s team got it closer than i imagined anyone would not 100 per cent some didn t smell right some were too thick too thin too waxy but after a few tweaks the factories were soon delivering a consistent product with the most amazing texture mistakes are the essence of being an entrepreneur without them we wouldn t have the kind of instructive experiences that make us better if there is one truth about queues it is their magnetic effect when people see a line it creates intrigue when you have intrigue you attract custom nothing beats the feeling of a customer in person or in writing raving about a fragrance how it smells to them the emotional connection they feel the memories it evokes and how they can t imagine wearing anything else we laughed every single day and the shop was a joy of a place to be that atmosphere matters in a small business camaraderie team spirit and keeping things light even in the intense moments are ingredients for success because everyone then wants to work hard and pull in the same direction you do not succeed in the luxury goods industry if there is an ounce of complacency every day needs to be brilliant and once you hit consistently brilliant days the question then has to be how can we make it better recovering from cancer is a lesson in rebuilding self confidence and the smallest gestures or comments from others seem to carry extra significance so when i walked into prada and the male shop assistant came over and said oh my god lady i love your look he had no idea the boost he gave me that day it was probably a standard compliment that he issued to others but those words made me feel feminine again if left to me entrepreneurship would be folded into the national curriculum young people are not only thinking quicker and smarter they appear to be more savvy innovation minded and prepared to go it alone we can only benefit if we better cultivate such vision and ambition at grass roots level children s experience of entrepreneurship shouldn t only be limited to lemonade stalls outside the front gate i noticed that it was the kids who struggled academically or who came from a more difficult background who proved to be the most creative the quickest thinkers and the best at problem solving stimulate interest at a young age and we stand a better chance of stimulating the economy many years down the road
