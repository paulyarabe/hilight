book_notes = ["The company was creating itself to conceive of and design and build small molecules better than the world’s most skilled, profitable, and heavily endowed research organizations and what it took from the scientists was utter commitment, extreme passion, thrilling insight, and fearlessness\\n\\nApril 23, 2018", "Within weeks Boger would announce that he had hired perhaps the most famous crystallographer in the pharmaceutical business, Manuel Navia. In 1988, in the record time of three months, Navia had led a team that found the structure of a major protein that causes the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus to replicate, a feat of such stunning general interest and public relations value to his employer that it landed him improbably on the Today show.\\n\\nApril 24, 2018", "Working most nights until ten, he then stayed up past midnight reading scientific journals, like his father. He worked every Saturday in a den off the kitchen at home. When he left the house now to drive to Logan Airport, as he often did, his two-year-old son refused to kiss him good-bye.\\n\\nApril 24, 2018", "In halting English, she reported on recent animal experiments in which the entire lower viscera of rats—liver, kidneys, stomach, duodenum, pancreas, large and small bowel, everything but the spleen—were successfully transplanted using FK-506. Such experiments had been tried previously with cyclosporine, but none of the rats had survived more than thirteen days. However, Murase’s animals had lived as long as seventy-two days (some would eventually live more than seven months), with no evidence of rejection even after she had discontinued the drug. Incredibly, the surviving rats had all put on weight.\\n\\nApril 24, 2018", "“The literature on transplantation of the kidney and other organs was uncompromisingly pessimistic, and therefore, paradoxically attractive,” wrote Starzl, who, it will be recalled, feared failure more than death. “This looked like the vacuum I was seeking.” As if to ensure that nothing in the path he chose for himself would be even remotely easy, Starzl decided to concentrate again on the liver\\n\\nApril 24, 2018", "Borel himself is more sanguine. “I’m afraid the definition of a scientist,” he has said, “is a man who can take frustration without end.”\\n\\nApril 24, 2018", "Like many others, he’d heard that a Japanese surgeon named Takio Ochiai had data on a new immunosuppressant that was one hundred times more potent than cyclosporine. Rumors of new drugs were not unusual at such meetings, and Ochiai, a middle-level professor at Chiba University, was assigned a small room to speak in. Quickly, it filled to overflowing. Borel was there. So was Calne. People attracted by the crowd pressed three- and four-deep at the doorway, straining to hear.\\n\\nApril 24, 2018", "Ochiai’s data were tantalizing. Experimenting mainly with beagles imported from the United States, he showed that the new compound, FK-506, worked in much the same way as cyclosporine by slowing the proliferation of T cells. Like cyclosporine, the molecule had shown up in a soil screen. It had been discovered in a dirt sample taken from the lower slope of Mount Tsukuba, an hour by train from Tokyo and just a few kilometers from the central screening facility of its discoverer, Fujisawa, the third-largest drug company in Japan. (FK-506 was an abbreviation of the molecule’s identification number, FK-506009.) Like cyclosporine, FK-506 also appeared to be toxic.\\n\\nApril 24, 2018", "Calne’s dog studies were at least ambiguous and should not stop the drug’s progress. (“Drugs kill dogs,” says Boger about the animal’s well-known proclivity for showing side effects unobserved in other species, “and dogs kill drugs.”) Working closely with the FDA, which sanctions all such clinical trials in the United States, Starzl’s team produced compelling enough evidence to warrant testing the drug in people.\\n\\nApril 24, 2018", "FK-506 was probably going to be a blockbuster drug: It would steal the transplant market from cyclosporine and would probably be safe enough to open up the autoimmune market. But, the Times article notwithstanding, it was unlikely to be safe enough to capture that market as well, so the greatest prize would be left for the next generation of compounds. Vertex couldn’t have asked for a better scenario\\n\\nApril 24, 2018", "Without their own leads, many of the companies would now likely end up looking to underwrite a small specialized research partner, which played directly into Vertex’s strategy.\\n\\nApril 24, 201"]
