book_notes = ["Speed is your friend because some evidence evaporates like a puddle in the sun. Memories lapse, witnesses walk, documents go missing too. So you want to get your hands on all the nuggets you can in short order. But undue speed can cause you to overlook evidence or misinterpret it. It can force mistakes. As the Roman senator Tacitus said, “Truth is confirmed by inspection and delay; falsehood by haste and uncertainty.” When you are always racing forward, it becomes hard to take a step back. But stepping back can be the key to a case. An investigator must maintain a near-impossible balance between patience and impatience. A burning drive to find the truth quickly is essential, but so is a calm resolve to take your time to get it right.\\n\\nSeptember 17, 2019", "My tenth day as U.S. Attorney was a Sunday. I was sitting in my office in jeans and a T-shirt, catching up on the voluminous weekly summary of criminal cases my unit chiefs put together regularly, when my deputy, Boyd Johnson, unexpectedly walked in with one of our fraud unit supervisors, John Hillebrecht. “John needs to talk to you,” he said. “We have a situation.”\\n\\nSeptember 18, 2019", "Boyd, my first, was one of my oldest and dearest friends, whom I promoted from corruption chief to deputy U.S. Attorney on my first day in the new job. Tall, athletic, and likable, Boyd is a keenly intuitive lawyer and an energetic and inspiring leader. We had worked together twice before, in private practice and at SDNY. I trust him like a brother. He was now my guide these first few days and weeks in office. Quick practice point: try if you can to work with your best and smartest friends in life.\\n\\nSeptember 18, 2019", "As U.S. Attorney, I established an honor in his name—the McCabe Medal—to be awarded at the annual office dinner, along with two other decades-old awards, to recognize a law enforcement agent who best personified Kenny’s ethic and character. What was it that so distinguished Kenny McCabe? Why should he be not only honored but emulated? One reason is that Kenny believed in the virtue of work. He didn’t take shortcuts, toot his own horn, or blame others for failure. He believed that you just do your job and you do it well. Every day. Even when it’s hard. Even when it’s dull or even when no one is looking. Even when the work seems small and beneath your title or God-given talent. Kenny took his pictures, made his rounds, followed his leads. He turned over rocks day after day after day, building cases he knew would take years to make or might not ever get made. Kenny was a brick-by-brick guy.\\n\\nSeptember 18, 2019", "Ambitious people tend to think of every endeavor as a ball game in which they’re going to pitch a perfect game. It doesn’t work that way. People should want to be monumentally successful—and Kenny, it should be said, was a very ambitious cop—but you’ve got to do it one pitch at a time. Pitch after pitch after pitch. That’s what develops into a perfect game or, by analogy, an outstanding career. No one who ever pitched a perfect game in baseball went to the mound that day expecting to do so. Not only is that unrealistic; it is the height of arrogance. Yet people all the time make that very mistake. They want to be great, before they’ve learned how to be good. The Kenny McCabes of the world know different. What else? Kenny was an expert. His devotion to tracking and tormenting mobsters was complete, bordering on compulsive. He knew everything there was to know about the Italian Mafia in New York and New Jersey. He simply knew more than anyone else.\\n\\nSeptember 18, 2019", "Many ambitious people do not have patience, and so their ambition yields little in the way of substantive results.\\n\\nSeptember 18, 2019", "An innocent man was accused and forever injured because of a failure to sufficiently reconsider. It was not the first error that wrought the injustice. First errors seldom do. It wasn’t the second or third error either. Rather, it was the continuing and lazy persistence in the first blunder—the mismatch of similar fingerprints by mistake but not with malice—followed by discoveries concerning Mayfield’s wife, work, and religion quickly accepted as corroboration instead of coincidence that greased a slow-motion miscarriage of justice through a fog of latent bias and stereotype. As I said at the outset and as the Mayfield case teaches, reconsideration is difficult, while confirmation is easy. It is much more difficult to keep your mind open when someone else in the chain of command has put forth a credible conclusion, or when you have already decided a thing. Changing your mind is hard, especially if it means going against an expert or a higher-up. In federal trial practice, there is actually a legal motion called a “motion for reconsideration.”\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "Courts almost never grant such motions, but it is a real motion that lawyers make. It’s a formal way of saying to the judge who screwed you, hey, I know we were just in your courtroom and we’ve been through all this, but respectfully we think you got it wrong and could you change your mind please? Good luck with that. Most lawyers understand that it’s a long-shot gambit, especially absent significant new facts or a change in the law. Some litigants don’t bother making the motion even if it has merit, because they fear irritating the judge still presiding over their case. It may be that most motions for reconsideration should be denied on the merits, but one wonders if the failure rate of such court pleas is influenced in part by the psychology of stubbornness.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "An investigator searching for truth and trying to assure just and fair accountability can never stop examining and reexamining conclusions about any aspect of the case. This is not to say that at each step of the way everyone involved in the case should be paralyzed by fear of making a mistake. But it does mean that even after someone seemingly smarter or more experienced than you has come to a conclusion, that conclusion should not necessarily stand forever. That’s true not only in the investigative stage but even after a charge has been brought. Even after an accusation has been filed, fair-minded people must continue to think about new evidence coming to light\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "Judge Learned Hand once, while testifying before Congress, laid claim to a phrase, borrowed from Oliver Cromwell speaking in a wholly different context in 1650. Learned Hand said of that phrase, “I should like to have [it] written over the portals of every church, every school, and every courthouse, may I say, of every legislative body in the United States.” What principle did Learned Hand wish every pastor, teacher, judge, and representative to remember just when crossing the threshold of their places of work? It was this: “I beseech ye in the bowels of Christ, think that ye may be mistaken.”\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "John O’Malley is not a very talkative guy. But he did say this to Glisson: “I hate to use the word ‘luck’ with you because a guy who went to jail for seventeen years, maybe you don’t use that word ‘luck.’ But for your letter to find its way to my desk is like divine intervention. That’s how lucky you are. That letter goes to anyone else, they wouldn’t have known anything.” It would have been just another letter by just another convicted criminal who was proclaiming his innocence. Dime a dozen. When asked about O’Malley, Glisson later said, “I thank God every day for John O’Malley. When I looked in that man’s eyes, I saw a man who has integrity; I saw a man who was honest.”\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "In the world of criminal law, asking innumerable questions helps avoid embarrassment, errors, and miscarriages of justice. A case is more likely to be harmed by suppressed questions than by suppressed evidence. This is true in all important endeavors involving truth. Deep understanding of any subject or set of facts requires active inquiry. That in turn requires asking questions. Every kind of question—searching questions, uncomfortable questions, broad questions, narrow questions, long-shot questions, repetitive questions, hypothetical questions. Many questions should be asked twice, perhaps even a third time, and rephrased each time to make sure the question was really understood and to make sure you understood the answer. Smart questions are good; dumb questions are even better. There is no such thing as a dumb question, the saying goes, but the shorthand is useful here. So-called dumb questions are often foundational; they tend to get to the basics, to the bottom line.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "Dumb questions uncover superficial reasoning, reveal bad logic, and expose fake experts. The world is populated, even in rarefied workplaces, with bullshit artists.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "I don’t know the right number of questions a person should ask in any particular context. But what I do know is this: find the person in the new job who asks the fewest questions, and there’s your problem. One veteran in my office gave this advice to newly minted supervisors: “People are going to come into your office and ask some crazy stuff. They’re not the ones you need to worry about. It’s the guy you haven’t seen in six weeks.”\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "In that moment of panic, his unmasking close at hand, Josh had a flash of genius. This is what he said, with a straight face, to the aspiring cooperating witness: “Listen, you may have to testify about all of this one day to a completely clueless jury. So you’re really going to have to break it down. So, as you explain the transactions today, I want you to pretend like I’m your nine-year-old nephew. Go slow and take it from the top.” Brilliant. It was a simple gambit but one that allowed Josh at once to save face, learn the case, and simplify the testimony. It gave him the space and excuse to ask questions to his heart’s delight—basic questions, ignorant questions, dumb questions, the kind anyone’s nine-year-old nephew might ask. He could be confused, and he could show his confusion. He could ask the witness to repeat himself, to say it again.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "It is an impossibility. In fact, I have come to believe that if you meet a leader who knows a super-impressive amount of minutiae and granular detail, that leader—with the possible exception of Steve Jobs—is likely failing at the job of leading, endlessly losing the forest for the trees that the subordinates should be tending to. Leaders need judgment more than knowledge, along with a reliable method of cross-examining those closer to the facts than they can ever be. A trustworthy method of inquiry, in the face of lesser knowledge—plus a good understanding of people—is how leaders make proper decisions.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "Here’s what I think: if you are listening hard and if your dumb questions address the heart of the matter, it’s okay. They may betray ignorance, but also likely show the right focus. If you have a penchant for asking foundational questions that people think you should already know the answers to, so what? You are on the right track. Ignorance is quickly remedied. A tendency toward the tangential, the irrelevant, the collateral, is not so easily fixed. It is okay not to know things, so long as you want to know things, care to know things, and when those are the things you actually need to know. Curiosity and query are among the most important pillars of sound leadership.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "My favorite question to ask often yielded the worst possible answer I could get; the question was, why do we do it this way? This may be an ignorant and basic question, but an even more ignorant and shameful answer was this: “We’ve always done it that way.” That is literally the only answer to any question that would actually make me angry. One might think it strange that I would be offended at this justification of tradition in the conservative task of law enforcement, but that answer is a barrier to innovation, a barrier to efficiency, and a potential barrier to justice.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "Asking questions as a junior person leads to deeper understanding. Asking questions as a leader does the same, plus it creates, one hopes, a climate of curiosity and self-reflection, for individuals and for the institution as a whole. And it fosters a culture of thoughtfulness, curiosity, critical thinking, understanding, and challenge, rather than rote acceptance of the status quo. Because that acceptance is how the mighty fall.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "Sometimes innovation requires a step backward when technology makes us less rather than more effective. Innovation—whether in relation to how a company makes a product or how an agent investigates a case—means constantly reevaluating and reassessing technology and the capacity for human error or lack of imagination. It also means resisting shortcuts, laziness, and complacency.\\n\\nOctober 5, 2019", "Profit and justice are different. Justice often must suffer the loss of substantial investment because that is what justice itself demands. When a backbreaking investigation does not yield enough evidence of a crime, when it turns out that a miscreant has come up to the criminal line but not put a thieving toe over it, when everyone thinks the target probably did the deed but doubts linger, when the law in its idiocy or a court in its naïveté has exempted from prosecution bad conduct that reasonable people loathe and want to punish, there is only one choice: to walk away. Walking away can be deeply and viscerally unsatisfying. But if all the raised expectations and personal investments and sunk costs sweep people toward an unjust charging decision, that is a miscarriage.\\n\\nNovember 29, 2019", "there is sometimes an internal source of pressure that is also dangerous and inexcusable. That occurs when leaders of an institution—even inadvertently—create pressure to produce a particular result. They do this by forgetting, as I sometimes did, to make clear that they are prepared to accept that there may be no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and that this is okay. Because profit and justice are different.\\n\\nNovember 29, 2019", "But even good-faith questions about the progress of an investigation, if asked with sufficient intensity (and frequency), can build a subtle pressure toward a particular outcome. Such a dynamic can convey that the leadership will be disappointed with anything less than a criminal charge whether the case is weak or not, whether the case is just or not. That kind of pressure, if not defused, can undermine both fair process and a just result. Leaders can’t be blind to that.\\n\\nNovember 29, 2019", "One evening, I heard secondhand from Rich Zabel that one of the corruption prosecutors had said, “I’m worried Preet will be pissed if we can’t make the case.” That was a full-stop moment. It might have been a passing remark, but to Rich (and to me) it was a wake-up call, because we realized that our well-meaning but endless badgering might be creating a pressure cooker. Now I became less concerned about the cases than about the morale and psyche of the teams. Passing remark or not, I was deeply bothered that at least one AUSA might have been worried about disappointing me rather than exclusively focused on finding the truth and making the fairest recommendation, whatever that might be. Rich and I decided to clear the air.\\n\\nNovember 29, 2019", "“I want to make sure that everyone understands something. I’m really proud of all of you. I hired most of you, and I did that because I trust you and I respect your judgment. We only stand for one thing in this place, and that is to do the right thing. And I ask a lot of questions about these cases because I care about them, because we can’t get it wrong, and because whatever we do will have consequences for the state of New York. And on people’s faith in government. And on the reputation of this office. But I want to make something very clear: I want you to be aggressive, thorough, and complete. And if on either case you guys tell me there’s not a proper charge to bring, I’m going to be just as proud of you and just as proud of this office as I would be if you recommended bringing charges. So I don’t want you to ever think that I or Rich or Joon or Dan is looking for a particular result. That’s not what we do here. That’s not what I want you to do. I’m sure you know that. I hope you know that. But I wanted to have this meeting to remove any doubt. We have the luxury in this office of being able to spend time, energy, and effort aggressively pursuing investigations of the most powerful people in the state and in the country because we think no one’s above the law. But as one of my predecessors used to say, ‘You judge an office not just by the cases it brings but also by the cases it doesn’t bring.’ And if it’s not right to bring a case, we won’t bring it.” I closed by saying, “I don’t want you to worry about this or me for one second.”\\n\\nNovember 29, 201"]
