Some 10 percent goes to women founders, and just 1 percent to African Americans. That’s not right—and it’s not smart. We need everybody on the playing field if we’re going to remain the most innovative, entrepreneurial nation in the world.\\n\\nJanuary 6, 2018", "I find that people are dismissive of ideas that they don’t empathize with. It’s much harder to make decisions, and take the time, to diligence a problem you’ve never faced, but it is the most important thing you can do.”\\n\\nJanuary 6, 2018", "Kapor Capital, which intentionally invests in underrepresented founders\\n\\nJanuary 6, 2018", "The Kauffman Foundation estimates that the average cost of starting a business is $30,000. Most entrepreneurs in most places—men and women, urban and rural, all races and classes—can’t afford that. The median level of wealth holdings for African-Americans and Latinos is under $9,000 (compared to over $110,000 for white families—more than ten times as high!).\\n\\nJanuary 6, 2018", "Other traditional sources of capital are drying up as well. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, community banks are most likely to lend to small businesses. 31 Yet the number of community banks has declined 41 percent since the financial crisis. 32 It turns out that bootstrapping is tougher than it sounds.\\n\\nJanuary 6, 2018", "In a 2014 study, Cambridge Associates illustrated how funds that intentionally integrated social impact and financial returns performed similarly in developed markets and outperformed in emerging markets. And a 2015 Wharton study showed that smaller funds that integrated purpose likewise outperformed those that didn’t.\\n\\nJanuary 6, 2018", "He asked one of the female entrepreneurs what her dreams were. She started talking about what she wanted for her family, her business, and her country. Then she turned to Bob and, with steely confidence, said, “What about you? What are your dreams?” Bob was floored. He saw himself as a partner, not a benefactor. “If our bank stopped making loans today, this woman would still be confident and successful. I saw a world of respect and trust.” It occurred to Bob that he could invest in microfinance banks (his “do-good pocket”) in the same way that he invested in real estate projects (his “business pocket”). He started looking for partners and, along with Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust, soon started a private equity fund to invest in—not make grants to—microfinance banks globally.\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2018", "He understands that people who have been successful in an industry are often not the best forecasters of new ideas. So he sources ideas from different people, consistently including entrepreneurs and community stakeholders in decision-making.\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2018", "Makers were better evaluators of new ideas; they tended to view their peers’ ideas not through a lens of “How well does this act resemble what has worked in the past?” but rather “How likely is this to succeed in the future?”\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2018", "A Maker thinks very differently about an idea, making what I’ll call a forecast. The Maker looks at the idea and thinks of all the reasons why it will succeed. Whereas an assessment is an evaluation against a fixed framework, a forecast evaluates a probability that a certain outcome will happen. Instead of “Do they have the right team?” it’s “How likely is it that with the right resources, they can build the right team?” Instead of “Do they have traction?” it’s “How likely is it that with the right resources, they can get market traction?”\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2018", "One superforecaster summed up the forecaster mind-set by saying that his strategy was “How likely is X to happen?” not “What do I think about X?” This is the approach investors should use when we are choosing which ideas are likely to be successful: forecasting potential rather than assessing progress via pattern recognition.\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2018", "I saw entrepreneurs playing a guessing game, fishing for the “right answers,” rather than having honest conversations about their business. Under the surface, they were asking themselves, “What do we need to do to get investment?” rather than asking us, “What do you think we need to do to be successful as a company?”\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2018", "If you’ve ever been in a room of your peers, you know who has potential and who doesn’t. You know which classmate of yours didn’t do the reading and doesn’t know his stuff—but manages to say something charismatic when the teacher calls on him. You know which classmate does all her homework but is too shy to speak up. You want to bet on the woman in the front row—but in the systems we have, the guy in the back tends to get the attention of the experts.\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2018", "For one thing, the cost of making smaller investments is lower, since managers don’t have to do diligence on hundreds of companies. Instead, entrepreneurs—who already have the market and sector context—can conduct in-depth analysis of one another’s businesses, building relationships along the way. Peer selection can also help scale investments to different locations—if your capital is in New York or San Francisco but you want to invest in, say, Des Moines or Nashville.\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2018", "as the Internet becomes more pervasive, Case argues that a third wave of startups will dominate how the Internet improves everyday life—from food to health to education to energy to transportation. And startups will lead the way, no matter where they are located—so long as they target the industries ripe for disruption. We see these disruptions everywhe\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2018", "In innovation, it’s better to be specific and wrong than vague and right.\\n\\nJanuary 12, 2018", "I called an investor I respect, who happens to be African-American. He said, “Investors buy stories, and Clarence is awful at telling his story. He needs to make his past an asset.” He recommended that Clarence come right out and say, “I grew up a poor black guy in Atlanta—I even had a criminal record—but I’ve worked my way up and now I’m running this company.” The lesson: If you have something that you think puts you in a blind spot, turn it into an asset. When you’re telling your story, leading with what you perceive to be your weakness will put you in a stronger position than ever.\\n\\nJanuary 12, 201"]
