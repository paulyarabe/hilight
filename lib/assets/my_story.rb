book_notes = ["I first started out with four plastic jugs, two saucepans, and a wing and a prayer.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "Smells unlock my every memory, like I’m moving through a sensory doorway to the past where all my senses translate into a scent or an aroma, conjuring a vivid recall. Transported to a specific time and place, I’m suddenly seeing, hearing, tasting and touching everything around me. This link between the sense of smell and human emotion would be one of the truths of fragrance I would come to understand\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "Patrick Süskind in his novel Perfume: ‘Odors have a power of persuasion stronger than that of words, appearances, emotions, or will . . . it enters into us like breath into our lungs, it fills us up, imbues us totally. There is no remedy for it.’\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "Eau Sauvage, a cologne by Christian Dior: unmistakably Dad, with his starched collar and crisp, white shirts ironed to within an inch of their life. He’s sitting in his armchair, right ankle resting on left knee, creating a cradle between his legs. He called this his ‘dip’ – the spot where I would sit, listening to his stories, facing his moustached smile, seeing the reflection of myself in his black, thick-rimmed glasses. This was my favourite place in the world.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "Even as a little girl, I knew from Mum’s choice of fragrance what her mood or the occasion was: Je Reviens by Worth – headed to work, serious, professional; Joy – going to London, feeling confident, out to impress at somewhere fancy; Ma Griffe by Carven – summer time, a spring in her step, holidays in Cornwall; and Mary Chess Tapestry bath oil – Friday night, unwinding, time to herself, the scent that infused the rest of the house whenever she took a bath\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "Whatever she wore, its composition nearly always contained notes of jasmine and rose, and I could often smell her before seeing her, either as a reassurance that she was close\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "I didn’t smell much money in my childhood.Instead, I can recall the array of scents from the amazing flowers in our back garden: the apricot, white and red roses; the blue lobelia, the greengage tree, the lemon-scented geraniums, and the fresh mint – the ingredients for my first home-made perfume mixed in a jam jar and left to ferment in Dad’s garden shed. This was no flashforward of my future – most girls experiment in this way, I think – but it was perhaps me trying to capture the pleasant smells of days spent in the garden\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "Even as a child, family meant everything to me, but that sense of cohesive togetherness was inconsistent and fleeting.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "No matter how tight things were financially, my parents constantly delivered a magical, happy Christmas – it’s why it remains my favourite time of year. Don’t ask me how they afforded it but, without fail, we woke to a generous amount of presents. We never went short in that regard.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "If there was one thing I learned from watching him stare into space, puffing away, it is the truth that you can’t force creativity. He could sit there for hours without picking up his brushes, but, as he explained, creativity needs to be respected. It is not a tap that can simply be turned on; it comes when ready, not when forced or unfelt. Waiting, he said, was part of the creative process. Let inspiration come to you. Don’t chase it.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "Within a few weeks, and when I felt confident enough, I started to emerge from his shadow more and more, telling curious customers about the story behind each painting. For example, take the clipper painting: I’d describe its history and the voyage it was embarking on, transporting them from the market and into the painting in the same way Dad had done with me. The hook of a good story often led to a sale – a mental note to be registered for later life.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "We weren’t allowed to interrupt her concentration but I’d watch her through the kitchen window and observe her intense focus. I could see how much this new job meant to her by the way she threw herself into these studies. Within no time, she had qualified with distinction as an aestheticienne (a beauty therapist) in the subjects of anatomy, physiology, and massage. I felt so proud of her – she had found that one thing in life that made her happy.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "But it was the lab, ‘where all the magic happened’, that left me endlessly fascinated. It was as heavenly white as a John Lennon Imagine video: white paint, white shelves, white cupboards, white cups, white plates, white racks. Underfoot, the black-and-white tiles ran throughout; on the walls were bevelled mirrors; on the ceilings, twinkling chandeliers. The whiteness of everything made the place feel so serene and safe.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "She showed me the beauty of creativity, the fantasy world of product, the magic of mixing lotions, and what it was to be an artist. She turned on a light in the deepest parts of me, and that light would only glow brighter with time.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "She also divulged a little-known tip that made me understand the reasoning behind whiteness in a room: one interior colour, plus very little sound, allows the eyes and ears to relax so that the scents in the air are the only stimulant for the senses.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "I soon saw for myself why her incredibly high standards had played a huge part in her success: if a pastry or cup of tea wasn’t perfect, she’d send it back, in the same way she would reject a face cream if it wasn’t absolutely perfect. ‘If you can’t do something perfectly,’ she told me once, ‘then don’t do it all. You must do everything brilliantly!’\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "I can’t say that my school years were a bed of roses, either. I have few fond memories of my time at comprehensive school. For me, this period was a rite of passage – the quagmire between childhood and adulthood that I had to wade through.I struggled academically, seemingly unable to retain any information; nothing would go in.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "Some afternoons, I’d come home and want to cry with frustration because I felt stupid; in fact, I worried endlessly that I was stupid. The teachers were of little help, and I didn’t feel able to speak with Mum and Dad because they seemed to have enough on their plates; moreover, I didn’t want to let them down with my poor performance. Not that they took much interest anyway.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "Madame Lubatti’s head moved, falteringly, and she looked right at me, or rather, through me. The eyes that once sparkled now looked as empty as a dried-up well. To see someone who has given so much to your life in such a state was the most shocking thing. I know Mum found it distressing, too – her tears told me that.The room was sparsely decorated with a generic painting on the wall. There wasn’t an oil bottle, face cream or herb in sight – nothing that plugged her into her heart and soul. Even as a youngster, I could see how such an ordinary environment hardly helped her cause.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "The trouble with my parents was that they were two tormented souls who adored one another, even though it sometimes didn’t sound or feel like it. They were the can’t-live-with-can’t-live-without type of couple. I know a deep love existed beneath all their ego and resentment. I know it because I witnessed it one Christmas morning.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "After Tracey and I had finished opening our presents in front of the fire, one little, unwrapped red box remained under the tree. ‘One more!’ I squealed. ‘What’s this?! What’s this?!’‘That’s for your mum,’ said Dad, taking it from me to present to Mum, who was all aflutter when she realised she had a surprise.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "Mum convinced him that, as he was a good cook who easily followed recipes, he would also make an able assistant. She left him with a copy of Harry’s Cosmeticology – the must-read book in cosmetic chemistry – and showed him what to do, step by step, over and over again, until satisfied that he knew what he was doing. Dad was a smart man and a fast learner and, equally as important, this new role gave him a sense of renewed purpose. Soon enough, he was running that kitchen-lab like he’d been doing it for years, allowing Mum to focus on her clients.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "When I arrived home from school and smelled oils and waxes, it was actually a comforting aroma, since it meant something was being made, something productive was happening and Dad was occupied, which meant Mum would be happy. With all pistons firing and all hands on deck, a busy house pulling in the same direction often meant a harmonious house and that was fine by me.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "Dad’s soul needed the stimulus of creativity and the respect of being valued by others.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "Don’t look back. Keep moving forward. When there’s a business to run, run it – that tends to be the best approach.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "It wasn’t Mills & Boon, it wasn’t Paris, it wasn’t planned, and there was no ring, but that was the most romantic thing he could have done in my eyes. Marriage is about ‘for better or worse’ and, at my worst, with no make-up, reddened eyes, and feeling desperately low, he was essentially telling me that he wanted me to be his forever, and that he’d be there by my side. For me, romance is about the intensity and meaning of a moment, and his strength and love had never meant more. I adored every aspect about this man – his heart, kindness, and compassion – and still do. From that day forward, his love would be the most constant thing I would ever know – unwavering and unconditional. Without it, without him, I wouldn’t go on to achieve anything.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2018", "Gary would drop me off in London around 9 a.m. and I would jump in a taxi throughout the day and bounce from house to house – from Belgravia to Knightsbridge, Chelsea to Kensington – until he picked me up around 6 p.m. I would continue in this vein for the next six months, building a platform, becoming established, and counting on this expanding network to keep putting my name out there.\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2018", "Think of how much we’ll save in taxi fares and petrol, he said; think of the extra facials you could fit in working from one home-based clinic, instead of dashing all over London. He calculated that by increasing the price of a treatment by £5 to £50, we’d pretty much break even initially. A move to London made sense on every level. Besides, the business, not us, seemed to be dictating matters. We decided to follow her lead and see where she took us. We did what every entrepreneur must do when they are in the fortunate position of being able to harness momentum – we decided to leap again, trusting in what we had.\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2018", "The flat was not luxurious by any means, even if the address may have been, and it was there that I discovered how much the sense of smell could bring luxury into even the most sparsely decorated room.\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2018", "I wanted the sense of luxury to permeate the whole flat, for my benefit and that of the clients. So I’d go to the nearby Crabtree & Evelyn, buy a spiced lemon cologne and spray the sheets and towels, even the net curtains, leaving a gentle scent of deliciousness. I’d place twigs of rosemary on a baking tray and turn the oven on low. I’d burn different types of scented candles, infusing the flat with clean, relaxing aromas that brought me a sense of security. I did all this instinctively at the time; the idea that I would one day create my own fragrances hadn’t yet crossed my mind.\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2018", "I wanted to create the kind of space where clients could unload their troubles and stresses and step into a calming bubble for body and spirit. I wanted to go beyond anything I had previously seen with Madame Lubatti and Mum. It had to feel sensational, like nothing anyone had known.\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2018", "Over the years, many people from all walks of life would trot up and down our three flights of stairs: from celebrities – actors, pop stars, TV hosts, supermodels, and members of royalty from around the world – to clients who would save up to afford a facial every three months.\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2018", "Skin doesn’t recognise class, and there is something about the intimate space between ‘the face girl’ and client that is a great leveller. The treatment room is a good place to realise that we’re all human, with the same skin issues, same emotions, same flaws, and that fame and wealth aren’t character traits. I took the privacy of each client seriously\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2018", "human nature is divided between those who thrive on, and get easily distracted by, gossip and they tend to go nowhere; and those people who know their purpose, know what they want, and won’t give weight to the chirpings of misinformed tittle-tattle because they know that such things are a waste of focus and energy.\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2018", "One week, I made a papaya mask with sandalwood powder, set in a cool jelly. But three women’s faces broke out in a rash and I had to hurriedly apply plain yoghurt as a soothing balm. Ironically, it was those flare-ups that led me to a breakthrough: the creation of a nourishing gel that calmed everything from rashes to sunburn to blemishes. Before I knew it, clients were raving about this ‘wonder product’, saying how much softer and fresher their skin felt after using it.\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2018", "As we talked, he said he could supply ‘the juice’ (le jus) – the concentrate of a fragrance that gives any cream, lotion, gel, oil or perfume its name. ‘I’ll tell you what I’ll do,’ he said, ‘I’ll put one kilo through as a sample and see how you get on.’\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2018", "Once the lotion had proved a hit, I set about making an accompanying bath oil, because I had long believed that the sensual experience of taking a bath required more than ambient warmth, steam and a few candles dotted around the edges. It demanded the luxury of fragrance.\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2018", "Nutmeg-Ginger Bath Oil actually became a gift to those clients who had been with me from the start, presented in my plain, white gift bags – my small way of saying ‘thank you’. In my mind, this gift formed only a sample of limited stock, and that’s when things started going crazy. Clients didn’t only order one bottle of bath oil but five, and then ten.\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2018", "I had a roll of sticky labels that we fed through a second-hand typewriter we’d bought for £25. Using two index fingers, I’d stab out the name of the product to be affixed to the back of the bottle; on the front, I’d use pre-printed stickers from Prontaprint bearing my initials, ‘JLM’.\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2018", "we’d then crawl back into bed and sit there, leaning back against our pillows, with notepads on raised knees, and discuss where we went wrong and what we could improve. And then, at the end of each month, we’d sit in the living room and spread our bank statements on the floor, cross-referencing them with my Ryman’s duplicate-page invoice book to calculate what money we had left over.\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2018", "We would come to realise that success begets success, and I think many entrepreneurs will associate with this: once you begin to feel successful, and embrace the natural momentum of the business, you tend to manifest a confidence that magnetises more success until it snowballs.\\n\\nJanuary 16, 201"]
