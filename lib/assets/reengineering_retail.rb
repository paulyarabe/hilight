book_notes = ["the experience is the marketing. The best way to generate demand for your retail offerings is through an experience so engaging that consumers can’t help but spend time in your place, give you their attention, and buy your offerings as a result. Doug beautifully defines remarkable experiences as those that are engaging , unique , personalized , surprising , and repeatable . How can you design and stage a store experience that fits those five adjectives? Read here to figure that out.\\n\\nOctober 11, 2017", "Most people aren’t aware that Facebook uses ninety-eight unique data points to triangulate the moment-to-moment interests, needs and preferences of each of its users—whether they are logged into Facebook or not! Yes, even if you’re not logged into Facebook, bits of code and plug-ins scattered elsewhere around the Internet will continue to trace your activity, with a direct pipeline back to the mother ship: Facebook.\\n\\nOctober 12, 2017", "going-in assumption needs to be that there is no longer any way to buy enough attention to succeed. If you’re not good enough at what you do to drive earned media, attention and reputation, then there’s no amount of paid advertising that will save you. Your advertising can be content-driven, programmatic, location-based or a good old-fashioned TV commercial—it doesn’t matter. The odds of piercing the noise and reaching people, in numbers, who happen to give a shit about your brand are almost nil.\\n\\nOctober 12, 2017", "We shop to discover Shopping, at its best, always holds the hope of profound moments of discovery. The thrill of the hunt and the uncovering of treasure affect us, as humans, on multiple levels. Ironically, as our lives become more hyperconnected by technology and driven by data, the world around us becomes less discoverable and the odds of encountering things in an unanticipated way become much slimmer. That may sound counterintuitive but it’s a fact. Increasingly, the people, places and things that make it into our field of awareness are being driven by data and predetermined algorithmically. Social networks such as Facebook don’t expand our circle of friends; they actually contract it by winding us more tightly in relation to information, products, events and people that we “like” and shutting the door on those people, places and things that we’re less inclined toward.\\n\\nOctober 14, 2017", "dating sites don’t attempt to bring uniquely different people together to create magic. They match people, like pairs of socks, in the interest of compatibility.\\n\\nOctober 14, 2017", "The true joy of shopping lies in the delicate balance of relevance and randomness. While it’s true that as shoppers we appreciate being exposed to things that appeal to our conscious needs and preferences, we also crave the surprise and delight of encountering shops we had no idea we’d love, products we didn’t know existed and experiences that come out of nowhere to surprise and enchant us. Physical stores can and should be these enchanted places. And data, no matter how good it is, can never replicate the experience of genuine discovery.\\n\\nOctober 14, 2017", "Crowds are the clearest and most immediate form of social proof , a reality that hasn’t changed since we climbed down from the trees tens of thousands of years ago. The presence of others in a space remains our best primal indicator that something of value is going on there. Most of us can relate to the adrenaline rush of being in a mall or a store and happening upon a feeding frenzy of shopper activity; it’s that feeling of excitement you experience when you sense that something big is going down.\\n\\nOctober 14, 2017", "Apple recognized that the same sense of social excitement was absent from its online experience. This realization led the company to apply for a patent for what it called “enhancing online shopping atmosphere” on its websites. As Apple put it, “One drawback of online shopping is that the experience can feel sterile and isolating. Customers in such an environment may be less likely to have positive feelings about the online shopping experience, may be less inclined to engage in the online equivalent of window shopping (e.g., will not linger in front of a display), and may ultimately spend less money than their counterparts who shop in physical stores.”\\n\\nOctober 14, 2017", "The dynamics created by real-world crowds feed into our innate fear of missing out on a good thing, and it’s this flash of excitement that makes for memorable and addictive retail experiences.\\n\\nOctober 14, 2017", "A shopper’s dopamine levels will be at their highest in anticipation of acquiring the thing they seek, and those levels will be even higher if there’s a known risk of not getting it. This outcome also goes a long way toward explaining the enduring appeal of off-price stores, outlet malls and even rummage sales, where shoppers have to treasure-hunt for bargains in their size, color or style. The mere fact that they may or may not find what they like produces enhanced dopamine levels.\\n\\nOctober 14, 2017", "So, as far as our brains are concerned, truly amazing retail walks a fine line between delivering consistency and dependability while also injecting the randomness of organic discovery and the fear of missing out. The subtle degree of chaos that we find in a physical shopping experience can, if engineered properly, add to the excitement of discovery. In other words, great shopping experiences are a sublime combination of predictability and chance\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "According to Blumenthal, “It’s about how can we create special moments. When you walk into the store, most people are really surprised, because it doesn’t look like any place they have ever been that sells eye glasses\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "stores are not places that stock products but rather “showrooms” where men can get fitted and select styles and fabrics for their suits\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "Second, and perhaps more importantly, these stores provide a live showcase for Amazon’s digital devices, such as the Fire Tablet, Fire TV, Kindle ereaders, Echo digital assistants and Dash Buttons. Unlike Apple stores, which famously entreated customers to discover, touch and play with new devices, Amazon has had no such proprietary touch-and-play point in the market until now. As a result, the company hasn’t been able to penetrate the market with its devices nearly as adeptly as Apple has—a lost opportunity considering that Amazon’s devices are, in essence, the portals to the entire Amazon value proposition\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "Indochino CEO Drew Green echoes a similar experience, saying, “Anytime we open a store in a city, we see awareness and sales in that city grow four times compared to what it was previously, as online-only.”6 I’ve also confirmed the same phenomenon with a number of large consumer brands. When they open a physical store, the result is very often an immediate jump in online sales. The math is physical stores equal more online sales.\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "November 7, 2017", "A 2016 U.K.-based study found that physical stores are most valued by younger consumers, noting: “The age groups most attached to stores are 16–24 and 25–34 year olds. Their use of online pure-play retailers is also notably low. This not only reinforces the importance of physical stores today, but also indicates their likely future importance.\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "one Millennial told us, ‘You want to touch it; you want to smell it; you want to pick it up\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "Yet another study found that nearly half of millennials value the experience they have with a brand more than the product itself. This number compared to only 22 percent of baby boomers. Forty-eight percent of millennials feel that the experience they have with a brand is the greatest predicator of loyalty, compared with 17 percent of boomers who feel the same\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "Digital is what we’ve become and yet visceral is what we are... it’s what we crave. Our need to detach from the Internet and escape to reality, if only for a while, is powerful and will continue to grow as we become increasingly chained to technology.\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "So, if we’re honest about it, the problem isn’t that millennials dislike physical stores; it’s that most store experiences suck. I’m not saying this lightly or for effect. I mean it sincerely. Most stores we visit are devoid of any theater, excitement or aesthetic delight, much less any sort of engaging physical experience. The vast majority of retail stores are havens of humdrum and bastions of boredom!\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "They’re making a huge assumption that consumers are craving more engagement with technology than they already have each day. In a world where we’re looking at our phones 220 times a day, a physical store shouldn’t simply be a place to go and look at it for the 221st time. A store needs to be a place where magic happens and, sometimes, that magic might involve technology but it needn’t have to.\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "It’s not about standing in the middle of a dusty warehouse speaking to a chatbot about product needs. It’s relating with an enthusiastic and delightfully human product expert who is empowered with technology that makes them even more expert. It’s not about using virtual reality to escape the boredom of the store. It’s using a remarkable store to escape reality—to enter a different world—just for a while.\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "So, finding the critical balance between the physical and the digital begins with skillful and thoughtful experiential design. Searching for experiential inflection points where shoppers can be physically engaged and immersed is key. Technology can be the spark that brings remarkable store experiences to life or it can be the connective tissue between the moments along the path to purchase, but retailers must never lose sight of the intrinsic physicality and joyfully kinetic nature of live retail. In a way, every store needs to be a small Coachella experience—an experience that engages all five senses and remains with shoppers long after they’ve left the store. An experience they feel in every cell.\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "Retail, today, lives and dies by square-foot sales. And it is for that single reason that a plethora of unique, fun, fashionable and fascinating products, concepts and innovations will likely never see the light of day on a major chain’s sales floor. This one metric throws cold water on any flame of creativity. What buyer is going to risk their job to fill a large amount of floor space with products that are unlikely to sell in large quantity—even if those products might add exponentially to overall shopper enjoyment or enhance their sense of discovery?\\n\\nNovember 8, 2017", "So, it’s not that consumers are killing retail. Retailers are killing retail and consumers are just innocent eyewitnesses to the crime. As long as retailers insist on maintaining their myopic focus on sales per square foot, stores will suffer, shoppers will get shortchanged and retailers will compound their difficulties.\\n\\nNovember 8, 2017", "Something has to break this cycle of boredom in physical stores. And the road to salvation begins with expanding our view of how success in a physical store can be measured above and beyond per-square-foot sales. We need to completely reinvent the purpose of a physical store and the means by which we measure its success.\\n\\nNovember 8, 201"]
