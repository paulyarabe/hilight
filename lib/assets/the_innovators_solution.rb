book_notes = ["The problem for growth-seeking managers, of course, is that the exciting growth markets of tomorrow are small today.\\n\\nJanuary 23, 2018", "We can trust a theory only when its statement of what actions will lead to success describe how this will vary as a company’s circumstances change. 23 This is a major reason why the outcomes of innovation efforts have seemed quite random: Shoddy categorization has led to one-size-fits-all recommendations that in turn have led to the wrong results in many circumstances.\\n\\nJanuary 23, 2018", "The Innovator’s Solution, in contrast, summarizes a set of theories that can guide managers who need to grow new businesses with predictable success—to become the disruptors rather than the disruptees—and ultimately kill the well-run, established competitors. To succeed predictably, disruptors must be good theorists. As they shape their growth business to be disruptive, they must align every critical process and decision to fit the disruptive circumstance.\\n\\nJanuary 23, 2018", "In sustaining circumstances —when the race entails making better products that can be sold for more money to attractive customers—we found that incumbents almost always prevail. In disruptive circumstances —when the challenge is to commercialize a simpler, more convenient product that sells for less money and appeals to a new or unattractive customer set—the entrants are likely to beat the incumbents.\\n\\nJanuary 23, 2018", "Disruptive innovations, in contrast, don’t attempt to bring better products to established customers in existing markets. Rather, they disrupt and redefine that trajectory by introducing products and services that are not as good as currently available products. But disruptive technologies offer other benefits—typically, they are simpler, more convenient, and less expensive products that appeal to new or less-demanding customers.\\n\\nJanuary 23, 2018", "New-market disruptors’ challenge is to create a new value network, where it is nonconsumption, not the incumbent, that must be overcome. Although new-market disruptions initially compete against non-consumption in their unique value network, as their performance improves they ultimately become good enough to pull customers out of the original value network into the new one, starting with the least-demanding tier.\\n\\nJanuary 23, 2018", "If the technology can be developed so that a large population of less skilled or less affluent people can begin owning and using, in a more convenient context, something that historically was available only to more skilled or more affluent people in a centralized, inconvenient location, then there is potential for shaping the idea into a new-market disruption.\\n\\nJanuary 23, 2018", "January 23, 2018", "If history is any guide, the commercially viable innovations in clean energy will not come from government-financed research projects designed to make solar energy a preferred source of power in developed markets. Rather, the successful innovations will emerge from companies who carve disruptive footholds by targeting nonconsumption and moving up-market with better products only after they have started simple and small.\\n\\nJanuary 30, 2018", "The target customers are trying to get a job done, but because they lack the money or skill, a simple, inexpensive solution has been beyond reach. These customers will compare the disruptive product to having nothing at all. As a result, they are delighted to buy it even though it may not be as good as other products available at high prices to current users with deeper expertise in the original value network. The performance hurdle required to delight such new-market customers is quite modest. The technology that enables the disruption might be quite sophisticated, but disruptors deploy it to make the purchase and use of the product simple, convenient, and foolproof. It is the “foolproofedness” that creates new growth by enabling people with less money and training to begin consuming. The disruptive innovation creates a whole new value network. The new consumers typically purchase the product through new channels and use the product in new venues.\\n\\nJanuary 30, 2018", "The growth in the new value network does not affect demand in the mainstream market for some time—in fact, incumbents sometimes prosper for a time because of the disruption. What is more, the incumbents are comfortable that they have sensed the threat and are responding. But it is the wrong response. They invest massive sums trying to advance the technology enough to please the customers in the existing value network.\\n\\nJanuary 30, 2018", "First, get top-level commitment by framing an innovation as a threat during the resource allocation process. Later, shift responsibility for the project to an autonomous organization that can frame it as an opportunity.\\n\\nJanuary 30, 2018", "A company’s channel includes not just wholesale distributors and retail stores, but any entity that adds value to or creates value around the company’s product as it wends its way toward the hands of the end user.\\n\\nJanuary 30, 2018", "there needs to be symmetry of motivation across the entire chain of entities that add value to the product on its way to the end customer. If your product does not help all of these entities do their fundamental job better—which is to move up-market along their own sustaining trajectory toward higher-margin business—then you will struggle to succeed. If your product provides the fuel that entities in the channel need to move toward improved margins, however, then the energy of the channel will help your new venture succeed.\\n\\nJanuary 30, 2018", "The same situation exists in service businesses. Just as lower-performing products can take root in simple applications and then get disruptively better, so too technological progress often enables less-skilled service providers to disrupt more highly trained and expensive providers above them.\\n\\nJanuary 30, 2018", "What kinds of customers will provide the most solid foundation for future growth? You want customers who have long wanted your product but were not able to get one until you arrived on the scene. You want to be able to easily delight these customers, and you want them to need you. You want customers whom you can have all to yourself, protected from the advances of competitors. And you want your customers to be so attractive to those you work with\\n\\nJanuary 30, 2018", "that everyone in your value network is motivated to cooperate in pursuing the opportunity. The search for customers like this is not a quixotic quest. These are the kinds of customers that you find when you shape innovative ideas to fit the four elements of the pattern of competing against nonconsumption.\\n\\nJanuary 30, 201"]
